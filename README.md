Abstract of this paper — 
Streaming high-quality video on mobile devices can
often be a huge drain on battery life. Especially when the
video quality remains constant despite fluctuations in battery
level and network status. This article presents an optimal video
streaming algorithm that depends on the device’s battery status.
Network status Optimizes media content for low battery usage
by dynamically adjusting video resolution and bitrate based on
performance. The proposed solution integrates protocols such as
DASH and HLS for smooth video quality transitions. It ensures
smooth playback and maintains a high quality experience (QoE).
The algorithm includes a new battery usage model. It takes into
account important factors such as video resolution, bitrate, and
playback time. Along with a video quality assessment framework
that combines PSNR, SSIM and VMAF measurements to strike a
balance between quality and performance. Reduce dynamic video
resolution to Reduced battery levels can save 25%-40% of battery
life while reducing buffering in low bandwidth situations by up
to 85%. This adaptive approach provides a scalable and energyefficient
solution especially for mobile e-learning applications.
Reduce battery drain and data usage without compromising
user satisfaction. By adjusting the video quality balance Battery
performance and network conditions Green calculation work in
media use, and contribute to the growth of sustainable technology.
